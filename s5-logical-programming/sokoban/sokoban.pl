% DFS solving framework

% The problem is solved if the state is equal to final_state.
solve_dfs(Problem, State, _History, []) :-
    final_state(Problem, State).

% If not, we have to explore new states
solve_dfs(Problem, State, History, [Move|Moves]) :-
    movement(State, Move),
    update(State, Move, NewState),
    /*legal_state(NewState),          Puede ser duplicado */
    \+ member(NewState, History),   /* No quiero ciclos en el grafo de b√∫squeda */
    solve_dfs(Problem, NewState, [NewState|History], Moves).

% Actually solve the problem
solve_problem(Problem, Solution) :-
    format('Problem: ~w', Problem),
    initial_state(Problem, Initial),
    solve_dfs(Problem, Initial, [Initial], [Solution]).
